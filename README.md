Technologies used in this application: JavaScript, CSS, HTML

This application represents the front end client side that is used for a car repair tracker.  Users can input their car repair's price, type, date, and car mileage in order to track repairs.  Those repairs can then be deleted, updated, or indexed.

One issue that came up during development was that the index feature for repairs showed car repairs for all users who had ever created a repair, rather than the user themselves.  This was fixed on the back end by requiring the index feature to search for an authorized user rather than just all events entirely.

In version two, I would like this app to have the ability to track multiple cars for a single user, rather than assuming a user has a single car.  Addtionally, I wanted to spend more time on the styling for this project but got sidetracked by events in my personal life.  Version two would add more fonts, animations, and use of bootstrap.
